                        roles from <i>The Village</i> and <i>Characters</i> expansion pack are not included due to
                        overcomplexity of rules and ambiguous description accordingly. </p>
                    <p>Most variants inhert majority roles and abilities from the original game with localization.
                        Therefore, their localized name will be appeared first along with translation or equivalent name
